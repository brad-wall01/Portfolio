# Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio that will be used as a means to showcase current and 
future projects I may have.

## Usage

The usage of this portfolio will be to show other people what I have accomplished
throughout the course. It will also give me something to reference to and keep updating
and improving as I learn more.
